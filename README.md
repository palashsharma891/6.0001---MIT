# 6.001---MIT
Here are my solutions to the problem sets in the 6.0001 course at MIT. I watched the course videos at edX and the problem sets here were downloaded from the OCW website. There isn't much of a difference between OCW and edx's problem sets. I did see both ;) 

I decided to include the dates of when these were written in the code(I use Spyder) to not freak people(and future me!) out.
